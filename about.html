What version of vegetarian diet a person follows depends on many things including health, environmental, ethical, religious or economic reasons.<br><br>

The main types of vegetarianism are:<br>

Lacto-ovo-vegetarian – people who do not eat any meat and seafood, but include dairy foods (such as milk), eggs and plant foods.<br>
Lacto-vegetarian – people who do not eat meat, seafood and eggs, but include dairy foods and plant foods.<br>
Ovo-vegetarian – people who do not eat meat, seafood and dairy foods, but include eggs and plant foods.<br>
Vegan – people who avoid all animal foods and only eat plant foods.<br>
Two other diets that are not strictly vegetarian but still focus on reducing or limiting the amount of animal products eaten are:<br>

Pescetarian – people who do not eat any meat, but include seafood, dairy foods, eggs and plant foods.<br>
Flexitarian – people who mainly have a plant-based diet but that sometimes includes small portions of meat and seafood; sometimes also called ‘semi-vegetarian’.<br>
People following pescetarian or flexitarian diets often do so to get the health benefits of eating a largely vegetarian diet without giving up meat entirely.
